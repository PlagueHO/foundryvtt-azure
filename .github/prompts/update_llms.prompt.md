Your task is to update the [llms.txt](/llms.txt) file located in the root of the repository. This file provides high-level guidance to large language models (LLMs) on where to find relevant content for understanding the solution's purpose and specifications.

**Instructions:**
- Ensure the `llms.txt` file accurately references all folders and files that are important for LLM comprehension, including the `specs/` folder (for machine-readable specifications) and the `docs/` folder (for developer and user documentation).
- If new documentation or specification folders/files are added, update `llms.txt` accordingly.
- Use clear, concise language and structured formatting for easy parsing by LLMs.
- Do not include implementation details or codeâ€”focus on navigation and content discovery.

Example structure for `llms.txt`:
